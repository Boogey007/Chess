							<h1>Setup of Chessboard</h1>

						Sizing of the chessboard consists of an 8x8 grid <i>(64 parts or squares)</i>. 
						Within this board there are eight lines running vertically along the board. These eight lines are assigned 
						numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Also, the lines running horizontally are designated with
						letters: a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h. The letters we have consist of an 'a' line 'b' line and so on. We use these letters such that
						'a' line is the first column 'b' line is the second column because each square belongs to one line and one row. If
						we were to call A5 that means we are going to the first column 'A' and up to the 5th row. A quick
						note that I must add is that the letter always comes before the number. So there cannot be 
						a move for a piece to 5A <b>ONLY</b> to <i>A5</i>.

						A student of Chess should know the Chessboard meticulously. When having to
						call out moves the players have to visualize the position of each individual 
						square and how it relates to the neighboring squares. At the beginning of the
						game you should have at least 16 pieces. These pieces should consist of: 8 pawns, 
						2 knights, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, a King and a Queen piece. Click the following <a href="chess2.html">link</a> 
						to go to the pieces and movement page. Here we will be explaining what the pieces look like as well as the moves associated
						with them and when they can be performed. There is a determined position for each piece for the start of the game and players take turns alternatively. 
						Chess pieces can be any color made out of just about any durable material but, when playing with black and white pieces whoever has the white pieces go first. <b>Remember</b> only one piece can be moved per turn except when
						castling.
						This is how your board should look

					A queen piece must be on the square that matches her color. Players will take pieces once an opponent's piece
					is within their path of movement. The only piece on the board that can take differently outside of their
					movement path is the pawn. This is because they only move forward and on their first move they can move one
					or two spaces. Pawns can make moves diagonally to take their opponents. Also, players CANNOT take or move through their own pieces. 
					The game ends on a either a Checkmate, Stalemate or a Draw. In a checkmate the game is clearly decided, a stalemate is when
					whoever turn it might be cannot make a legal move and their King is not checked or checkmated the game is essentially over. Whoever is 
					stalemated does not lose or win the game.
